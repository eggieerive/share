let's build a 'guess the word game'. i will tell you the steps.


That sounds like a fun project! I'm ready when you are. Just let me know the first step.






ask for the number of letters


Okay, what's the number of letters you want the secret word to have?






it will be an input to the game


Got it. The number of letters will be an important input for the game's logic.

Now, what is the secret word?






build the html app that asks for the number of letters


Here is the HTML app for the first step of the "Guess the Word Game," which asks the user to input the number of letters in the secret word.

This app is fully responsive and uses Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern look. It validates the user's input to ensure they enter a positive number.
Guess the Word Game - Step 7

This draft handles the first step of the game and is ready for the next phase. Let's add the functionality for the next step. What would you like to do next? For example, we could add a new input for the user to guess a word, or we could add a button to generate a random word of that length.





make a table with the number of columns based on the input.

the headers will be numbers from 1 to the number of letters input.

spread the letters of the alphabet on the table. example, if input is 5. then:



1 2 3 4 5

A B C D E

F G H I J

K L M N O

P Q R S T

U V W X Y

Z



I've updated the Canvas to include the table you requested. The game now moves to a new state after you input the number of letters, displaying a grid of the alphabet with headers matching your input.

Here is the updated code for the "Guess the Word Game."

I have now set up the game to handle the first two steps. The initial setup screen now hides after a valid input, and a new game area appears with the alphabet table formatted as you requested. I also added a placeholder input and button for the next step, which would be to guess a letter.

How would you like to proceed? We can add logic to handle the user's guesses, or perhaps we can add functionality to generate a random secret word for the player to guess.





next step is:



ask for the 5 numbers where the letters of the word can be found starting from the first to the last letter.



make a new table based on the 5 numbers with the column values as rows and 1 to maximum columns resulted.

example if input is 1 1 1 2 5

new table is



1 2 3 4 5 6

A F K P U Z

A F K P U Z

A F K P U Z

B G L Q V

E J O T Y



I have updated the game to include the next step you described.

The game now progresses as follows:

You enter the number of letters for the secret word and click "Start Game."

The alphabet table is displayed, and a new form appears asking you to input the number of the column where each letter of the secret word can be found.

After entering those numbers and clicking "Generate Table," a new table is created and displayed. This table is constructed using the columns from the original alphabet table based on the numbers you provided.

Here is the updated code for the game.

The game is now one step closer to completion. The next logical step would be to add the actual secret word functionality, perhaps by making the game generate a random word of the specified length and checking the user's guesses.

What would you like to add or change next?





the new table header numbers should conform to the new number of columns of the new table


I've updated the "Guess the Word Game" to fix the new table's header numbers so they correctly match the number of columns in the table. The code now dynamically calculates the number of columns in the new table (which is the same as the number of rows in the original alphabet table) and sets the headers accordingly.

Here is the updated code:

I've fixed the issue in the createGuessTable function. Now, the new table's headers will be generated based on the number of rows in the original alphabet table, ensuring the header numbers match the number of columns in the new table.

What's next for our "Guess the Word" game? We could add the final input field for guessing the secret word, or we could add a "Play Again" button to restart the game.





next step:



ask again for the next 5 numbers where the letters now appeared on the new table. generate the new table again the same way previous table was generated.



I have updated the game to add the next step you requested. The game now proceeds to a third phase where it asks for another set of column numbers to generate a new table.

Here is the updated code for the game.





add a reset to make the game start all over at any point in the game. the last step should offer a new game option.


I've updated the "Guess the Word Game" to include a reset option, as you requested.

You'll now find a "Reset Game" button at the top of each stage of the game. Once you reach the final table, the "Generate Final Table" button is replaced with a "Play Again" button. Both of these buttons will reset the game and take you back to the beginning, ready for a new word.

Here is the updated code for the game.

The game now has a reset function that can be triggered at any point. We could also add a final text input field for the user to guess the word, or we could add a feature to automatically generate a secret word. What would you like to do next?





Add a reveal button at the last step to reveal the word via a modal window.

The word is the diagonal letters combined from column 1 row 2 to last column last row.



I've updated the "Guess the Word Game" with a new feature to reveal the secret word.

At the final step, after you've generated the last table, a new "Reveal Word" button will appear. Clicking this button will open a modal window displaying the secret word. The word is determined by combining the letters found on the diagonal of the final table, starting from the second row, first column, and continuing to the last row, last column.

Here is the updated code for the game with the new reveal functionality.

The game now allows you to reveal the secret word based on the final table. A new "Reveal Word" button has been added, which, when clicked, will display the final word in a modal.

We've now completed all the steps of the game flow you've requested. Do you want to add a feature for the user to input their guess and check it against the revealed word, or would you like to add anything else?





Replace the title with 'Guess The Word Game'. Remove subtitle.


I have updated the game to reflect your requested changes. The title is now "Guess The Word Game," and the subtitle has been removed.

Here is the updated code for the game.

The game's title is now Guess The Word Game and the subtitle has been removed. Everything else, including the reset and reveal functionality, remains the same.

Would you like to add an input field for the user to try and guess the word themselves before revealing it?
